			<Text>A Tidal Power Plant is renewable energy source which harnesses the energy of tides to produce usable electric energy. Tidal energy can take many forms, including stationary or tethered turbines similar to undersea wind turbines, or tidal barrages that mimic traditional hydroelectric stations. Tidal energy solutions are especially attractive in comparison to wind and solar because of their consistency and predictability.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Of the various renewable energy solutions available, tidal energy is the youngest and still the most problematic. Corrosion and wear are costly hurdles to wide deployment of tidal power, as well as the limited number of potential sites with high flow velocities. Today, tidal power contributes less than 1% of total global power generation, with facilities in France, the UK, South Korea, and Canada.</Text>
