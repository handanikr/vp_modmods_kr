			<Text>A National Park is a natural landscape conserved and protected by a sovereign government. National Parks are established to preserve relatively untouched wilderness for various reasons, including posterity, national pride, research, and tourism. The oldest National Park is Yellowstone National Park, USA, which was established in 1872. The world's first government bureaucracy with a specific mandate to administer a country's national park was Parks Canada, founded in 1911.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]National parks are almost always open to visitors. Most national parks provide outdoor recreation and camping opportunities as well as classes designed to educate the public on the importance of conservation and the natural wonders of the land in which the national park is located.</Text>
